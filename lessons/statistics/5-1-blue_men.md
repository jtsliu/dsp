[Think Stats Chapter 5 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2006.html#toc50) (blue men)

5' 10" = 177.8 cm
6' 1"  = 185.42 cm

Distribution of heights for men is roughly normal at µ = 178 cm and σ = 7.7 cm
Since the distribution is roughly normal and 5'10" to 6'1" is 1 standard deviation away, the rough percentage of
the U.S. male population in the range is approximately 34%

Note: After taking a look at the textbook provided solutions, I confirmed my solution, but I didn't find a need to use
programming given the nice fit of the values given.
